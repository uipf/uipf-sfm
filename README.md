Structure From Motion Framework for UIPF
========================================

This package provides the basic data types for SfM modules on UIPF.

No special dependencies other than UIPF are needed, except that it
requires UIPF to be built with OpenCV support (`-DWITH_OPENCV=ON`, the default).
